/**
 * <p> Doomsday algorithm is a mathematical method for calculating the day of the week for any given date.
 * It was devised by John Horton Conway and named after the day of the week, doomsday, upon which certain years are based.
 * The algorithm relies on knowing the doomsday for each month, which is a specific day of the week that falls on certain
 *  dates within each month. By using simple calculations based on the known doomsdays, you can determine the day of
 *  the week for any date.
 *
 * <p>Special days
 * 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 5/9, 9/5, 7/11, 11/7 - are all same day of the week in a year
 * <p>Jan 3rd, Feb 28th also share the same day of the week with the dates above if the year is not leap year.
 * If year is leap year then Jan 4th and Feb 29th share the same day of the week.
 * 14th of March shares same day of the week with the dates above
 *
 * <p>How do we know the special day for a year?
 * <p>- Special day is the next day of the week compared to the previous year except leap years, which will be two days
 * after the previous year.
 * <p>1700 - Sunday, 1800 - Friday, 1900 - Wednesday, 2000 - Tuesday and the pattern repeats over and over again
 * - Every 27 years the Special day pattern repeats, for example 1700 - Sunday and 1728, 1756, 1784 are also similar.
